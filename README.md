# Karaoke

In the following project I have build working prototype of Karaoke which is form of entertainment where people take turns to sing songs into a microphone over prerecorded backing tracks.

The project is divided as - 

Admin -  
   1 - Who can add new songs

   2 - Save the songs which are previously added
     
Singer - 
   1 - Who can browse the songs according to artists, so that they know what songs are available

   2 - Can choose a song and place in a queue 
         
Karaoke Jockey - 

1 - Should be able to call out the next song in the queue and make video available for singers to sing
